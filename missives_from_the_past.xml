            <title>how to remember yourself</title>

                <p>reach up and run your hand over the top of your head. do you
                    feel hair? do you feel skin? do you feel cloth? this is a
                    part of you which you cannot ignore. inhale, and suck the
                    air into your lungs. the capilaries that press against the
                    surface of those air sacks were grown by your body some time
                    ago. exhale. thank yourself for continuing to function.</p>
                <p>you were made long ago, but not too long ago. countless
                    smaller organisms touch your body at all times, forming an
                    ecosystem unique to your chemistry, your experiences, your
                    history. every other body you've brushed past with your own
                    will exchange some of this ecosystem. how do you justify
                    separating yourself as a singular entity, discrete from all
                    others?</p>
                <p>relax. we're all in this together.</p>
